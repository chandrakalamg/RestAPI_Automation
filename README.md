Restful Booker API Automation

Hallo, I have created this test framework in BDD style with RestAssured and coded in Java and following tools are required to run this test suite:

1. RestAssured
2. TestNg
3. Maven
4. Eclipse
5. Postman
6. BDD Framework

Steps to run the code
1. Download the project and Import in Eclipse.
2. Installation of TestNg and Maven, if not already available in user's machine (Assuming Java is already available in user's machine)
3. Run the code as Maven test or TestNg test suite or run from command prompt as mvn clean install (provided maven installed)
4. Execution results can be found under "sourcedrive:\API_Automation\RestfulBooker\test-output" under project location
